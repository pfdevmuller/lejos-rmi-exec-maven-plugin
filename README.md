# lejos-rmi-exec-maven-plugin
Work in Progress

This is intended to be a maven plugin that can upload to and launch jars on a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick using the LeJOS RMI menu. This is similar to what the LeJOS Eclipse Plugin does, but without the need for Eclipse.

At the moment, it is just some hardcoded prototyping.

See http://www.lejos.org/ for more context.
